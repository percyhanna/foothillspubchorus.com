We would love for you to join us at the next [**#FoothillsPubChorus**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FoothillsPubChorus) event at the Royal Duke Hotel in Okotoks, and it's free! Come and join in the singing, have a laugh and a drink or two perhaps!

No singing experience or talent is required, and don't worry if you don't know the songs - we have singers who will lead, and the words will be on screens in the pub.

You can also view the songs in our [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WI-AoAYRjA-9-h6aE6HQipBJj18rkeom).
