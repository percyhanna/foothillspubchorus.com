**[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/383641028772909/)**

We are excited to invite you to the first ever **#FoothillsPubChorus** event at the Royal Duke Hotel in Okotoks, and it's free! Come and join in the singing, have a laugh and a drink or two perhaps!

No singing experience or talent is required, and don't worry if you don't know the songs - we have singers who will lead, and the words will be on screens in the pub.

You can also view them in our [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WI-AoAYRjA-9-h6aE6HQipBJj18rkeom).
